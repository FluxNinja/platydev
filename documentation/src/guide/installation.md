# Installation

## Prerequisites

## Installation

```
yarn global add @platyplus/devtools
```

The Platyplus DevTools CLI is now installed. You can run it with the `platy` command line.

Most of the sub-commands are taking multiple arguments. You can either ask the syntax in adding `--help` to the command you want to use, or run the command without arguments: it will either print help on the command, or prompt you the missing information. [Find out more about the Platy CLI](../cli).
