# TODO

- [ ] Vetur errors -> monitor the new Vetur releases
- [ ] vite template -> serviceTypeConfig.command = "yarn create {{xyz}}"
- [ ] postgres docker, helm & template
- [ ] rabbitmq docker, helm & template?
- [ ] optimise generated dockerfiles - use common layers?
- [ ] move templates to the root folder
- [ ] rename config.yaml to platy.yaml (or .platy.yaml?) -> ? use the k8s terminology with kind: platyplus/project, name: project name ?
- [ ] generate tsconfig/tsconfig.build files for each project? -> case of tilehuria-schema
- [ ] add documentation to monorepo template?
- [ ] update versions in helm chart generated by devtools? Only if none or if using '\*'?
- [ ] tilehuria worker is not an http server -> chart not really adapted. Maybe rename simple-http to service, and be able to deactivate port
- [ ] how to publish docker images with correct tags -> custom skaffold builder?
- [ ] preserve yaml comments e.g. https://www.npmjs.com/package/yawn-yaml
- [ ] ? merge traefik and cert-manager charts?
