A wrapper of several filesystem utils meant to supplement the standard fs package with:

- [fs-extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra)
- [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob)
- [tmp](https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp)
- [yaml](https://github.com/eemeli/yaml)

It also includes some custom-made functions for manipulating YAML files.

## Installation

yarn add @platyplus/fs
