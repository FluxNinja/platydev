# Packages & Artifacts

Platyplus is designed to be as generic as possible, so they can be extended more easily, or even used in other contexts:

- Helm charts
- Docker images
- A [Pulumi package](artifacts/pulumi) to quickly deploy a production-ready Digital Ocean cluster
- <a href="https://tilt.dev/" target="_blank">Tilt</a> extensions to ease Hasura/Platyplus development on a Kubernets cluster
- Javascript packages for custom frontend build
